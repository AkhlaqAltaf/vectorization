719158963401056753^ And he will take upon him death that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the flesh that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities (Alma 7:11 12).^Because God loves you and wants you to become your best He sent His perfect Son to earth to redeem you. An important part of Jesus Christ s mission was to be our advocate. He overcame suffering and affliction so that he would know how to support us. He knows you perfectly and knows how to help you if you turn to God in prayer and ask for guidance.^As you turn to God and Jesus Christ your faith will be strengthened and act as an anchor in the storms of life. Christ s gospel can teach you the way to lasting joy and the truths taught in His Church can bring peace and hope.^Your friends and family can be a wonderful source of support and happiness including the friendships formed at church. At their best our church congregations are caring communities where we minister to each other in practical and spiritual ways.
719158962997135268^Have you ever wondered why you re here? Why God created this earth and placed you on it? If you feel deep in your soul that there must be some greater purpose to your life than simply existing you can find answers by turning to God.^We believe that we existed before this earth began living with God as His children in spirit form. Like a parent sending their child off to school our Heavenly Father sent each of us here so we could gain a physical body and learn and grow to become more like Him before someday returning to live in His presence.^Because God knew that our growth would require that we make choices and experience opposition He sent His Son Jesus Christ to be our Savior and to help us find lasting happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ promises peace enduring joy and strength to those who faithfully follow God s commandments and are baptized into Christ s Church. The Book of Mormon teaches:^While experiencing sorrow is a natural part of this life it is not meant to be the only thing you experience. God blessed us with many beautiful and wonderful things to enjoy on this earth.
719158965988964264^ I had all kinds of questions. Who was my Savior? Did Heavenly Father know me? What was His plan for me? They were always willing and ready to answer my questions and they always had resources to back them up. Back^ The missionaries finally said to me If you want to know if this is true don t take our word for it. Go to the source of all truth. And that s what I did. When I asked God if what they were telling me was true it brought a feeling of love joy and peace. Back^ They just really want to be like their Savior Jesus Christ. That s it. They have nothing but good intentions and nothing but love. Back^ When we first met the missionaries they brought happiness. They radiated joy and love. Back
719158963435981660^Yes. Jesus made it clear that baptism is necessary to enter the kingdom of heaven, teaching we must be born of water and of the spirit ().Jesus Himself was baptizedeven though He was perfectto set an example for us.^Do I need to be baptized again if I was already baptized in a different church?^Yes. Many who have beenbaptized in another church took that step in good faith, with a sincere desire to accept and follow Jesus Christ.We believe that when it comes to sacred ordinances or acts that are essential for our eternal salvation, we need to follow the pattern established by Jesus Christ. This means thatbaptisms must be performed by priesthood authority from God and in a manner consistent with how Jesuswas baptized (by immersion).Being baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints followed by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost by someone who has the authority from Jesus is the way the Savior showed to become a member of His Church.^How do I join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?

719158963914175829^In the New Testament the Apostle Paul taught In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established (2 Corinthians 13:1). Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints cherish the Bible as one of those witnesses and the Book of Mormon as another witness of Jesus Christ.^Like the Bible the Book of Mormon is a divinely inspired record compiled by ancient prophets. It records God s word to His children in the Americas. You can receive clarifying inspiration insights and guidance through reading both books of scripture together.^The Book of Mormon starts with the story of a prophet named Lehi who was warned by God in about 600 BC that Jerusalem would be destroyed. Lehi and his wife Sariah led by the Spirit of God brought their family across the ocean where their descendants eventually grew to become two nations known as the Nephites and Lamanites. Their stories of faith in God and preparation for Jesus Christ s coming provide inspiring examples to follow while other accounts in the Book of Mormon emphasize God s mercy for all His children or warn against sin.^The pinnacle event of the Book of Mormon is Jesus s visit to His followers in the Americas after His death and Resurrection. This visit fulfilled His teaching in Jerusalem:
719158964564863648^2 And Jesus went out and departed from the temple; and his disciples came to him for to hear him saying: Master show us concerning the buildings of the temple as thou hast said They shall be thrown down and left unto you desolate.^3 And Jesus said unto them: See ye not all these things and do ye not understand them? Verily I say unto you there shall not be left here upon this temple one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.^4 And Jesus left them and went upon the Mount of Olives. And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying: Tell us when shall these things be which thou hast said concerning the destruction of the temple and the Jews; and what is the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world or the destruction of the wicked which is the end of the world?^5 And Jesus answered and said unto them: Take heed that no man deceive you;
719158963092932284^Visitors are welcome to participate, but they are not required to.

The most common attire youll see at church is a dress shirt and tie for men and a skirt or dress for women.
719158965497639286^Russell M. Nelson was sustained and set apart as the 17th president and prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Sunday January 14 2018 in the upper room of the Salt Lake Temple.^Born September 9 1924 President Nelson is the son of Marion C. and Edna Anderson Nelson. He and his wife the former Dantzel White have ten children. Sister Nelson passed away in February 2005. In April 2006 he married Wendy L. Watson.^Prior to his service as head of the Church President Nelson served as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from July 15 2015 until his call as the Church s leader. He has served as a member of that quorum since April 7 1984.^An internationally renowned surgeon and medical researcher Dr. Nelson received his B.A. and M.D. degrees from the University of Utah (1945 47). Honorary scholastic societies include Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Alpha.

719158963186249160^When God sent us here to earth to learn and grow He knew we would make mistakes. So He sent us a Savior Jesus Christ to provide a way for us to repent and to be saved from physical death.^We believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ as the literal Son of God and a distinct member of the Godhead along with God the Father and the Holy Spirit. Jesus came to earth to experience the trials of a mortal life teach and testify of God perform mighty miracles and complete His atoning sacrifice which would allow us to be cleansed from sin and to be resurrected.^Jesus s example is one of pure love. He showed us how to love God by striving to do His will above all else. He compassionately healed the sick and disabled fed the hungry raised the dead cared for the poor welcomed the social outcasts and ministered to all who faithfully sought Him out.^You can have faith that the Savior extends that same love and compassion to you.
719158962963552698^As your loving Father in Heaven God sent you here to earth to learn and grow. Families play a crucial role in your growth here on earth.^Family is the central building block of a strong society. We aspire to build strong family relationships. Home can be a place where we feel support safety and love. Every family can look and feel different. But as we connect with God we can have stronger families that provide for spiritual emotional and physical needs.^If your family is a great source of love and joy in your life it might be hard to imagine any definition of heaven that doesn t include those relationships. Part of the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that families can be together forever.^In the Bible Jesus gave the twelve Apostles priesthood authority promising that Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven (Matthew 18:18). That same authority from God unites (or seals )husbands and wives and parents and children together for eternity in temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today.
719158966124002188^You can find us living, working, and raising families all around the world. For us, being involved in our community is one way we can love our neighbor as Jesus taught.^Instead of full-time paid clergy, we all play a part in our local congregations through leadership roles, speaking assignments, and other volunteer opportunities.^For us, church is more than Sunday worshipits also a place to find support through friendships and experiences that strengthen faith and offer practical help for lifes challenges.^What to Expect at Church
719158962211436752^It says Visitors Welcome on all our buildings and we mean it! Whether you re interested in becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints visiting with a friend or just exercising a little curiosity we re happy to see you.^Church is a place of community and learning but most importantly it s a place to worship God and Jesus Christ. All 30000 of our congregations around the world follow a similar two-hour format for Sunday services:^During what we call sacrament meeting all members of the congregation meet together. The meeting includes an opening and closing prayer a few hymns and sermons given by fellow Church members.^The most important part of sacrament meeting is taking the sacrament which is similar to Communion in other Christian religions. During the sacrament we remember Jesus Christ as we take a small piece of bread and cup of water that are symbolic of the body and blood He sacrificed for us. During this quieter time we try to think about ways we can follow Him more faithfully during the coming week.
719158962362913444^At important times in our lives we can strengthen our relationship with God and receive special blessings from Him through covenants. A covenant is a sacred promise between God and His children here on earth. God gives the conditions for the covenant and He gives us the choice to accept them. As we honor the promises that we have made we can have complete faith that God will always fulfill His promises to us. The opportunity to have a covenant relationship with God is available to all His children.^For members of the Church the first covenant we make with God takes place when we are baptized. Covenants are often made through sacred ordinances like baptism. An ordinance is a religious ceremony performed with the authority of God s priesthood. After baptism we receive the Holy Spirit through another ordinance. Together these sacred commitments offer us a fresh start. Our sins are forgiven and we become members of Jesus Christ s Church. Keeping covenants with God strengthens us throughout our lives.^When we are baptized we promise God we will keep His commandments show love to others and take Jesus Christ s name upon us. And if we do these things God promises to forgive our sins bless us with His Holy Spirit and help us return to live with Him forever.^We renew the covenant we make at baptism each Sunday at church as we take the sacrament of the Lord s Supper (which is similar to Communion or the Eucharist). This beautiful reminder of our covenant is patterned after the sacrament that Jesus introduced to His Apostles before His death.
