During the sacrament we remember Jesus Christ as we take a small piece of bread and cup of water that are symbolic of the body and blood He sacrificed for us. During this quieter time we try to think about ways we can follow Him more faithfully during the coming week.

A covenant is a sacred promise between God and His children here on earth. God gives the conditions for the covenant and He gives us the choice to accept them. As we honor the promises that we have made we can have complete faith that God will always fulfill His promises to us. The opportunity to have a covenant relationship with God is available to all His children.^For members of the Church the first covenant we make with God takes place when we are baptized. Covenants are often made through sacred ordinances like baptism. An ordinance is a religious ceremony performed with the authority of God s priesthood. After baptism we receive the Holy Spirit through another ordinance. Together these sacred commitments offer us a fresh start. Our sins are forgiven and we become members of Jesus Christ s Church. Keeping covenants with God strengthens us throughout our lives.^When we are baptized we promise God we will keep His commandments show love to others and take Jesus Christ s name upon us. And if we do these things God promises to forgive our sins bless us with His Holy Spirit and help us return to live with Him forever.^We renew the covenant we make at baptism each Sunday at church as we take the sacrament of the Lord s Supper (which is similar to Communion or the Eucharist). This beautiful reminder of our covenant is patterned after the sacrament that Jesus introduced to His Apostles before His death.^We renew the covenant we make at baptism each Sunday at church as we take the sacrament of the Lord s Supper (which is similar to Communion or the Eucharist).
